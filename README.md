## Nick_Sniper
A simple python based program to snipe nicks on League of Legends and change them automatically.

# Install
To execute the program you will need to have python installed and run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
on your terminal.

To run the program you need to be with the League Client open, or it will not work
I recommend to just snipe the nick with 5 hours or less to it be open, to see some nicks that are
going to be available, you can use this site:
- https://lols.gg/
- https://lolnames.gg/
- https://www.nameslol.com/ (NO BR SERVER SUPPORT)

# Updates
v1.1
The endpoint to attempt to change the nickname apparently does not exists anymore, but the try is there!

v2.0
Added some new features, like:
- Notify sound when the nick be able to change;
- API redirect to change your nick when available (you'll only need to put your credentials and nick on API site);
- Date to nick if isn't available;
- No need to be on account to snipe (you can snipe any nick without having 13900 BE);
- Region snipe!

Improved the installation and execution ways too!
To install just run this command on powershell:
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the program, just run:
`start.bat` file.


# Disclaimer
Due to new league Riot ID "nicks", this code probably don't work. So if you want to test, its by your own risk.
