# Nick_Sniper
A simple python based program to snipe nicks on League of Legends and change them automatically.

To execute the program you will need to install some python libraries, the links:
https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/
https://lcu-driver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Or if you prefer, just run those commands in your terminal:
$ pip install lcu-driver 
$ pip install aiohttp

To run the program you need to be with the League Client open, or it will not work
I recommend to just snipe the nick with 5 hours or less to it be open, to see some nicks that are
going to be available, you can use this site:
